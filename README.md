# Battery Aging Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the aging characteristics of lithium-ion batteries using a dataset provided by the NASA Battery Dataset on Kaggle (referencing data from ThinkClock Battery Labs). The assignment involves three main tasks: visualizing Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data with respect to aging, performing Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA) and visualizing its peaks over aging, and training a machine learning model for capacity prediction based on EIS signatures.

**Note:** The provided Jupyter Notebook code and the available CSV data differ from the format described in the assignment (which specifies `.mat` files containing EIS data). This README outlines the intended scope based on the assignment description and acknowledges the adaptations made due to the available data.

## Project Objectives (Based on Assignment)

1.  **EIS Data Visualization:**
    * Create a 3D plot showing the change in Impedance (Real part - Re(Z) on the X-axis, Imaginary part - Im(Z) on the Y-axis) as the battery ages (Cycle count on the Z-axis).
    * Assume other parameters like Temperature remain constant for this visualization.

2.  **Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA):**
    * Derive an ICA plot (dQ/dV vs. Voltage) from typical charge/discharge cycle data.
    * Create a 3D plot illustrating how the peaks observed in the ICA plot change with respect to the battery's aging (cycle count).

3.  **Machine Learning for Capacity Prediction:**
    * Train a machine learning model to predict the current capacity of the battery cell using the current EIS signature as input features.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the NASA Battery Dataset, as referenced in the assignment: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickfleith/nasa-battery-dataset/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickfleith/nasa-battery-dataset/data)

The assignment description indicates that the data is provided in `.mat` files with experiment details in associated `README.txt` files. However, the currently utilized code reads `.csv` files.

## Code Structure (Based on Provided Notebooks)

The provided Jupyter Notebook code includes the following sections:

1.  **Data Loading:** Reads battery data from `.csv` files.
2.  **EIS Data Visualization:** Contains a placeholder for creating a 3D EIS plot. **Adaptation:** Due to the lack of direct EIS data (Re(Z), Im(Z)) in the `.csv` files, the current code adapts this section to visualize Voltage, Current, and Time as a proxy for aging in a 3D scatter plot.
3.  **Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA):**
    * Calculates the incremental capacity (dQ/dV) from voltage, current, and time data.
    * Generates a 2D plot of ICA (dQ/dV vs. Voltage).
    * Includes a basic method to identify ICA peaks and visualizes them in a 3D scatter plot against Time (used as a proxy for aging).
4.  **Machine Learning for Capacity Prediction:**
    * Contains a placeholder for training a machine learning model. **Adaptation:** Due to the absence of direct EIS data and a clear "Capacity" column in the `.csv` files, the current code adapts this section to predict 'Time' using other available features ('Voltage\_measured', 'Current\_measured', 'Temperature\_measured', 'Current\_load', 'Voltage\_load'). A Linear Regression model is used, and its performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error. The actual vs. predicted 'Time' is also visualized.
    * Min-Max scaling is applied to the features before training the model to potentially improve performance.

## Running the Code

To execute the analysis, run the cells in the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment_PythonDeveloper (1).ipynb` or similar). Ensure that the `.csv` data files are located at the specified paths in the code.

## Observations and Limitations

* **Data Format Mismatch:** The assignment specifies `.mat` files containing EIS data, while the provided code works with `.csv` files that do not inherently include EIS measurements in the expected format. This necessitates adaptations in the EIS visualization and machine learning sections.
* **Proxy for Aging:** In the absence of a direct 'Cycle Count' column in the `.csv` data, the 'Time' column is used as a proxy for aging in some visualizations.
* **Capacity Data:** A clear 'Capacity' column for direct prediction in the machine learning task might be missing in the `.csv` data. The current adaptation predicts 'Time' instead.
* **Simple Peak Detection:** The ICA peak detection method used is a basic approach and might not be robust for all datasets. More sophisticated peak finding algorithms could be employed.
* **Linear Regression for Time Prediction:** Linear Regression might not be the optimal model for predicting 'Time'. Exploring other regression techniques could yield better results.

## Further Improvements (If Correct Data Were Available)

If the dataset contained `.mat` files with EIS data (Re(Z), Im(Z), and Cycle count) and a 'Capacity' column, the project could be improved by:

* Implementing the 3D EIS plot as originally intended.
* Potentially extracting features from the EIS data for use in the capacity prediction model.
* Training a machine learning model to directly predict 'Capacity' using EIS features.
* Exploring more advanced machine learning models for capacity prediction.
* Conducting a more thorough analysis of the relationship between EIS signatures and battery capacity degradation.
